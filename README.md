# Tesla's Stock Price Prediction Using Facebook Prophet
This project focuses on predicting Tesla's stock price using the Facebook Prophet forecasting model. The following tasks were performed to complete the project:

Task 1: Importing All the Necessary Libraries
In this initial step, we imported all the required libraries and packages, including Facebook Prophet, Plotly Express, Pandas, and other essential libraries for data handling and visualization.

Task 2: Importing the Dataset from Yahoo Finance
We retrieved the historical stock price data for Tesla from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from 11/06/2023 to 11/06/2024. This data served as the foundation for our forecasting model.

Task 3: Data Visualization Using Plotly Express
To gain insights into the historical performance of Tesla's stock, we visualized the data using Plotly Express. This step included plotting the time series data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.

Task 4: Data Preparation & Modelling
We prepared the data for modelling by transforming it into the format required by Facebook Prophet. This involved renaming columns to 'ds' (date) and 'y' (value), handling missing values, and other preprocessing tasks.

Task 5: Forecasting
Using the Facebook Prophet model, we generated forecasts for Tesla's stock price. We trained the model on the historical data and made predictions for the next 30 days.

Task 6: Automating Stock Forecasting for Other Stocks
In this step, we extended the project to automate the forecasting process for other stocks. By adapting the code, users can input different stock tickers and obtain forecasts using the same methodology.
